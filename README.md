# Mapping Speeding Offences in Australia: A Data-Driven Interactive Dashboard for Safer Roads

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background and Motivation
Road safety remains a significant public concern in Australia, with speeding consistently identified as one of the leading causes of serious injuries and fatalities. Although enforcement data has been collected by the Bureau of Infrastructure and Transport Research Economics (BITRE) since 2008, the public Police Enforcement Dashboard still lacks details and interactivity that would allow for deeper data exploration by users.  

In 2023, BITRE began collecting finer-grained data such as location, age group, arrests, and charges; however, this information is not yet visualised or made easily accessible to the public.

### 1.2 Intended Audience

#### 1.2.1 General Public and Concerned Citizens
- **Expertise:** Low to moderate digital knowledge, minimal background in data interpretation.  
- **Context:** Interested in road safety in their city or region, particularly parents, drivers, and community members.  
- **Information Needs:**
  - View the number of speeding fines by area or age group.
  - Understand which regions or age groups are most at risk.
  - Use intuitive visualisations to explore local safety issues and changes over time.
- **Justification:** Clear, map-based or timeline visualisations with tooltips and filters help interpret data without technical knowledge. Their use of the tool can influence safer personal driving behavior and community awareness.

#### 1.2.2 Policy Makers and Government Officials
- **Expertise:** Moderate to advanced policy knowledge; interpret data for funding or enforcement strategy decisions.  
- **Context:** Need evidence-based insights to allocate resources or advocate for new road safety initiatives.  
- **Information Needs:**
  - Compare jurisdictional trends in speeding over time.
  - Evaluate which detection methods (e.g., camera vs police-issued) are most effective.
  - Assess enforcement outcomes (e.g., arrests, charges) by region.
- **Justification:** Dashboards with trend analysis, zoomable details, high-quality filtering, and demographic breakdowns support strategic decision-making.

#### 1.2.3 Transport and Public Health Analysts / Researchers
- **Expertise:** High technical skill in data analysis; interested in long-term trends, spatial patterns, and predictive indicators.  
- **Context:** Seek to identify risk patterns or anomalies that inform future research or technical models.  
- **Information Needs:**
  - Access full historical datasets with breakdowns by age group, location, and detection method.
  - Overlay socio-demographic or population data for correlation analysis.
  - Require accurate legends, scales, and access to raw figures.
- **Justification:** Analysts benefit from visualisations that support data download, hover-based microdata, and clear annotations explaining derived metrics.

### 1.3 Visualisation Purpose
The primary goal of this visualisation suite is to enable users to answer four core questions, each corresponding to one of the four interactive charts implemented:

1. How have total speeding fines trended annually from 2008 to 2022?
2. What is the age-group distribution of speeding fines in the most recent year (2023)?
3. How do different detection methods (camera versus police) compare in their contribution to total speeding fines over the period of record?
4. Which jurisdictions incur the highest volume of speeding fines, and how are they geographically distributed?

### Visualisation Goals and Benefits
- Enhance public understanding of road safety enforcement patterns.
- Support government transparency by making enforcement data accessible and explorable.
- Improve decision-making for policy makers by highlighting hotspots, trends, and under-served regions.
- Encourage proactive behaviour by allowing individuals to explore offence trends in their area.
